## üîß Troubleshooting

- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: "Camera is already in use"
**Solution:**
- Close other apps using the camera
- Close other browser tabs with camera access
- Restart your browser

### Issue: Hand not detected
**Solutions:**
- Improve lighting (face a light source)
- Move hand closer to camera
- Show palm clearly to camera
- Ensure camera lens is clean

### Issue: Gestures not working
**Solutions:**
- Move hand more slowly and deliberately
- Move hand vertically (up/down) not horizontally
- Keep hand in frame at all times
- Check console for debug messages (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

### Issue: Works on desktop but not mobile
**Solutions:**
- Ensure using HTTPS (not HTTP) on production
- Check mobile browser supports camera API
- Clear browser cache
- Try a different browser

## üéÆ Performance Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Good Lighting**: Face a window or light source
2. **Stable Hand**: Move slowly and deliberately
3. **Clear Background**: Plain background works best
4. **Camera Quality**: Better camera = better tracking
5. **Browser Performance**: Close other tabs to free up resources

### Mobile-Specific Tips:
1. Use Wi-Fi for faster MediaPipe loading
2. Close background apps for better performance
3. Keep phone cool (hot phones = slower processing)
4. Portrait mode generally works better than landscape

## üîê Privacy & Security

- Camera feed is processed **locally** on your device
- No video or images are uploaded to any server
- Hand tracking happens entirely in your browser
- Camera turns off when you stop Air Control
- Works offline after initial MediaPipe model download

## üåê Deployment Checklist

When deploying to production:

- [ ] Enable HTTPS on your domain
- [ ] Test camera permissions on iOS Safari
- [ ] Test camera permissions on Android Chrome
- [ ] Verify MediaPipe CDN is accessible
- [ ] Test on 3G/4G networks (not just Wi-Fi)
- [ ] Add camera permission explanation before requesting
- [ ] Test with both front and back cameras
- [ ] Verify responsive design on various screen sizes

## üìä Debug Mode
